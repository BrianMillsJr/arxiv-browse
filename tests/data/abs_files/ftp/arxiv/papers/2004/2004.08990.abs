  A semiempirical model, based in the logistic map, has been succesfully
applied to forecast important quantities along the several phases of the
outbreak of the covid-19 for different countries. This paper shows how the
model was calibrated and applied to perform predictions of people needing to be
hospitalized, needs of ventilators, or the number of deaths which would be
produced. It is shown specifically the results obtained in the case of Spain,
showing a prediction of diagnosed infected and deaths which will be observed
after the ease of the total lockdown produced the 13th of March. Is also shown
how this model can provide an insight of what the level of infection in the
different regions of Spain is forecasted. The model predicts for Spain for the
end of May more than 400,000 diagnosed infected cases, number which will be
probably higher due to the change in the possibilities of performing massive
number of tests to the general population. The number of forecasted deaths for
that date is 46,000 +/- 15,000. The model also predicts the level of infection
at the different Spanish regions, providing a counterintuitive result in the
cases of Madrid and Catalonia as the result shows a higher the level of
infection at Catalonia than the level at Madrid, according with this model. All
of these results can be used to guide policy makers in order to optimize
resources and to avoid future outbreaks of the covid-19.
