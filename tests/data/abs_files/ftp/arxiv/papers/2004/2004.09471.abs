  When effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available,
non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, home quarantine and
far-reaching shutdown of public life are the only available strategies to
prevent the spreading of epidemics. Based on an extended SEIR model and
continuous-time optimal control theory, in this paper the optimal
non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy is presented for the case that a
vaccine is never found. In this case, the optimal control must meet two
competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and,
second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of herd immunity at the end of
the measures, in order to exclude a second wave. The presented control strategy
is a single-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated
interventions and simple "flattening of the curve". The characteristic time
course of the computed optimal control is the following: After an intense but
short initial lockdown, a dynamical equilibrium is enforced during which the
number of actively infected is held on a constant level for a longer period of
time. At the same time, the measures can be gradually relaxed with an ever
increasing speed. Two simple rules for the optimal control of the effective
reproduction number are presented, see Eqs. (13)-(14), which ensure a stable
route out of the initial lockdown. The rules are directly applicable in
practice, as they only depend on a precise knowledge of the cumulative number
of cases and a reliable estimate of the effective reproduction number. The
obtained results could serve as a guideline for the implementation and gradual
relaxation of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures also in other scenarios,
e.g., when the development of a vaccine is expected soon. The model system is
calibrated to reproduce the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19
epidemic in Germany.
