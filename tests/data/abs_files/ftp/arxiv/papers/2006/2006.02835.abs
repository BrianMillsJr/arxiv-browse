  This paper reviews and offers remarks upon Viro's definition of the Khovanov
homology of the Kauffman bracket of unoriented framed tangles (Sec. 2). The
review is based on a file of his talk. This definition contains an exposition
of the relation between the $R$-matrix and the Kauffman bracket (Sec. 2.2).
